2. -The Process ID is: 13082
   -The Process ID is: 13091
   -The Process ID is: 13101

3. Parent Process: PID is 13168, and child's PID is 13169
   Child Process: PID is 13169

4. On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child. On failure, -1 is returned in the parent,
no child process is created, and errno is set appropriately.

5. Parent Process:     PID is 13481, and child's PID is 13482
Child Process: PID is 13482

6. Child Process PID is 13560
Parent Process PID is 13558, and my child's PID is 13560
Child process has finished.

The program waited 3 seconds for the parent process to finish and then competed the child process, which is what I expected.

7. The parent process waits for the child process to finish before proceeding, and only exits once it finishes.
